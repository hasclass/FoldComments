# FoldComments

Sublime Text 2 package that hides/folds code comments. Ideal if you have heavily documented ruby code.

This package is inspired by the code and discussion here: http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=4620

## Tested with:

FoldComments does not work with all programming languages, it's been reported to work with at least:

* Ruby
* CoffeeScript

## Installation

In Sublime Text:

* Make sure "Package Control" is installed (http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)
* Cmd+Shift+p
* Go to (start typing): Package Control: Add Repository
* Enter: https://github.com/hasclass/FoldComments
* Cmd+Shift+p
* Go to (start typing): Package Control: Install Package
* Type FoldComments

## Useage

Cmd+Shift+/ will fold/unfold multi-line comments.

Single line comments are not folded.
